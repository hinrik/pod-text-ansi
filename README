NAME
    Pod::Text::Ansi - Convert POD to ANSI-colored text

SYNOPSIS
        use Pod::Text::Ansi;
        my $parser = Pod::Text::Ansi->new (sentence => 0, width => 78);

        # Read POD from STDIN and write to STDOUT.
        $parser->parse_from_filehandle;

        # Read POD from file.pod and write to file.txt.
        $parser->parse_from_file ('file.pod', 'file.txt');

DESCRIPTION
    Pod::Text::Ansi is a simple subclass of Pod::Text that highlights output
    text using ANSI color escape sequences. Apart from the color, it in all
    ways functions like Pod::Text. See Pod::Text for details and available
    options.

CAVEATS
    *   It currently doesn't respect some forms of nesting.

        Example:

         I<'italic', C<'italic code'>, 'italic'>.

        Contrary to what the three terms above say, they will be rendered as
        italic only, then code only, then normal, respectively.

        Non-overlapping nesting such as the following does work, though:

         I< C<italic code> >

    *   The wrapping code isn't perfect.

        Some formatting codes that stretch over multiple lines will break.
        One example would be an "L<>" code that's too long to fit on one
        line.
